# What is TypeInference ?
`Type inference is the capability of compiler to determine the type of the data, by using the information that is already available in the code; literal values, method invocations and their declaration. For a developer, type inference reduces verbosity`

**Type Inference with var**
```
var name = "Java11";         // variable 'name' inferred as String
var dateTime = new LocalDateTime.now();  // var 'dateTime' inferred as LocalDateTime
```
