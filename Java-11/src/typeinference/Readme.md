# What is TypeInference ?
`Type inference is the capability of compiler to determine the type of the data, by using the information that is already available in the code; literal values, method invocations and their declaration. For a developer, type inference reduces verbosity`

**Type Inference with var**
```
var name = "Java11";         // variable 'name' inferred as String
var dateTime = new LocalDateTime.now();  // var 'dateTime' inferred as LocalDateTime
```
- `var` cannot be left uninitialised. e.g., var x; var x=null. The code won't compile.
- The following code won't work. var can't be used to catch exceptions.
```
class Foo {
    public static void main(String   args[]) {
        try {
           char[] name = new char[]{'S','t','r','i','n','g'};
           for (var c : name) {
               System.out.println(c + ":"   + (c + 1 - 1));
           }
        }
        catch (var e) {
            //code
        }
    }
}
```

**var with Primitive data types**
```
var counter = 9_009_998_992_887;       // code doesn't compile
var counter = 9_009_998_992_887L;       // code compiles
var aChar = (char)91;                   // code compiles
```

```
// type of result inferred as int; 'result' stores 2
var divResult = 5/2;

// result of (5/2), that is 2 casted to a double; divResult stores 2.0
var divResult = (double)(5/ 2);

// operation of a double and int results in a double; divResult stores 2.5
var divResult = (double)5/ 2;
```

- Arithmetic operation
- In an arithmetic operation, if either of the operand is char, byte, short or int, the result is at least promoted to an int.
```
byte b1 = 10;
char c1 = 9;
var sum = b1 + c1;        // inferred type of sum is int
```

```
byte cupsOfCoffee = 10;
long population = 10L;
float weight = 79.8f;
double distance = 198654.77;

var total1 = cupsOfCoffee + population;     // inferred type of total1 is long
var total2 = distance + population;        // inferred type of total2 is double
var total3 = weight + population;    // inferred type of total3 is float
```

# Type Inference with derived classes
`child` class extends `parent` class. When you create a local variable and assign it an instance of the Child class, the type of the variable is inferred as Child.
```
class Parent {
    void whistle() {
        System.out.println("Parent-Whistle");
    }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    void whistle() {
        System.out.println("Child-Whistle");
    }
    void stand() {
        System.out.println("Child-stand");
    }
}
class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var obj = new Child();
        obj.whistle();
        obj.stand();     // type of obj inferred as Child
    }
}
```
- Refer to `DerivedClassTest2`. The code won't compile.
`Type of variables defined using var are inferred at compile time.
If the return type of a method is used to assign a variable defined using var, its inferred type is the return type of the method; not the type of instance returned during run time.`

# Type Inference with Interfaces
- `InterfaceTypeInferenceTest.java`

# Using var with Arrays
```
var name = new char[]{'S','t','r','i','n','g'};
```
![var-array](images/var-array.jpg?raw=true "var-array")

# Type Inference with Generics
`When using var with generics, ensure you pass relevant data types within the angular brackets on the right-hand side of the assignment; so that you don't lose type safety.`
```
var names = new ArrayList<String>();
```
- Refer Pen class in generics package. The issue is trying to modify the immutable collection, using Collections.sort()

# Passing variables to method
- Class MethodConstruct.java
`As long as the inferred type of a variable matches with the type of method parameter, it can be passed to it as an argument.`

# Reassigning values
- As applicable to all non-final variables, you can reassign a value to inferred variables. Just ensure that the reassigned value matches with the its inferred type. The type of a variable is inferred just once.
- The type of a local variable defined using var is inferred only once.
```
var age = 9;     // type inferred as int
age = 10.9;      // won't compile

StringBuilder query = new StringBuilder("SELECT"); // Type - StringBuilder
query = query.toString() + "FROM" + "TABLE";       // won't compile;
                          // can't convert String
                          // to StringBuilder

```

# Explicit casting
```
var age = 29;           // inferred type of age is int

byte age = 29;                // Option 1 - no type inference
var age = (byte)29;           // Option 2 - explicit casting

var letter = (char)97;        // inferred type of letter is char
var debit = (float)17.9;      // inferred type of debit is float

class Automobile {}
class Car extends Automobile {
    void check() {}
}
class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        var obj = (Automobile)new Car();
        obj.check();     // Won't compile; type of obj is Automobile
    }
}
```

# Assigning null with explicit casting
```
var name = (String)null;             // Code compiles
```

# Limitations
- The usage of var types is limited to the local variables in Java.
- They are not allowed in public API, as method parameters or as return type of methods.

```
class var {}          // can't use var as class name
interface var {}      // can't use var as interface name
class Demo {
    int var = 100;               // can't use var as instance variable name
    static long var = 121;       // can't use var as static variable name

    void var() {                 // can't use var as method name
        int var = 10;            // cant use var as the name of a local variable
    }
    void aMethod(String var) {}  // can't use var as the name of method parameter
}
```

**Code Refactoring**
- Don't refactor your existing or legacy code, replacing existing explicit types in methods with var. It doesn't offer any benefits.
